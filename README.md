# Voting Eligibility

> The project consists of creating an application that will print if a user is eligible for voting or not based on their age. We will have our developers creating a greeting message asking the user for their name and age, where their age must be greater than or equal to 18 to confirm if they are eligible to vote. At the end, we will be asking the user to participate in a simple survey to measure their experience on a scale of 1 to 5.
